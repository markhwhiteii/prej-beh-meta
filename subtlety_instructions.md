**Please read *carefully*.**

Psychologists have been studying “race relations” for decades; I’m trying to understand these studies better.
 
There have been hundreds of these studies, and they look at many different things. I am asking you to read a little bit about these studies, and then answer a few questions about your opinion. Mostly, I want you to tell me about how you see the “experimental situation,” how does it look to you?
 
The technical name for a person participating in an experiment is a “participant,” and the person running the study is called the “researcher.” *In the studies, we are interested in how a participant might respond to a person of “the other race.”*  The response is called a “behavior,” or a “negative behavior.”
 
Before we start, I want to tell you a few things about how this research often works, so you can be informed about how to judge it:

1. Researchers will often tell participants a story about the study, which may leave out some details, or misdirect the participants, to make it less obvious.
 
2. A lot of the time, participants are not aware that the study is about race or race relations at all, but sometimes they are asked directly about people of another race.

3. Researchers will not draw the attention of the participants to the fact they are interacting with someone of another race. Many times, researchers will do this by showing a picture of the person without commenting on race.

For each paradigm, each description followed the stem: "In one study..." The participant then answered the following questions:

1. Would it be easy for the participant in the study to figure out that the behavior they are doing is about race?
2. Would it be easy for the participant to fake it so that they look less prejudiced than they actually are?
3. Is this an obvious way to measure negative behaviors towards people of another race?
